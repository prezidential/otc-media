# Cornerstone OS
## System Specification v2.1

Owner: OnTheCorner Media  
Module: Newsroom Engine + LinkedIn Module  
Status: Active Development  
Supersedes: v2.0 (sections marked **[REVISED]** replace v2.0 equivalents; sections marked **[NEW]** are additive)

---

# 1. Core Mission [REVISED]

Cornerstone OS exists to eliminate blank page friction and transform research into structured, voice-consistent, monetizable media assets — for any B2B thought leadership creator.

It must:

- Ingest research autonomously
- Extract structured editorial angles
- Generate viewpoint-driven drafts
- Enforce per-creator writing constraints
- Support modular section regeneration
- Persist structured draft objects
- Prepare publish-ready drafts across multiple output channels
- Support multiple creators via workspace-scoped configuration
- **Operate as a team of specialized agents, not a sequence of button clicks**

It is infrastructure, not a chatbot. It is a product, not a single-creator tool. It is a newsroom, not a prompt template.

---

# 2. Design Principles [REVISED]

1. Structured over freeform
2. Modular over monolithic
3. Deterministic over magical
4. Persist state, do not recompute everything
5. Human approval before publish
6. Voice guardrails enforced at system level
7. Replaceable LLM abstraction
8. Creator-configured, not system-hardcoded
9. API-connected over file import
10. Workspace-scoped by default
11. **Agents over endpoints** — each pipeline stage is an autonomous agent with tools, memory, and judgment — not a dumb prompt call
12. **Human gates, not human labor** — humans approve, they don't operate

---

# 3. System Architecture [REVISED]

## 3.0 Multi-Tenancy Model
_Unchanged from v2.0._

---

## 3.1 Agent Architecture [NEW]

### Overview

Cornerstone OS operates as a **newsroom staffed by specialized agents**. Each agent has a defined role, a set of tools it can invoke, memory of its previous runs, and the ability to make autonomous decisions within its scope.

```

```

### Agent Definition

Each agent is defined by:

```typescript
type AgentDefinition = {
  id: string;                          // e.g. "researcher"
  name: string;                        // e.g. "Researcher Agent"
  role: AgentRole;                     // maps to LLM config
  systemPrompt: string;                // persistent identity and instructions
  tools: AgentTool[];                  // functions the agent can invoke
  triggerMode: "scheduled" | "event" | "manual";
  humanGate: boolean;                  // if true, agent stops and waits for human approval before next stage
};

type AgentTool = {
  name: string;                        // e.g. "query_signals"
  description: string;                 // what the tool does (provided to LLM)
  execute: (params: unknown) => Promise<unknown>;
};

type AgentRunState = {
  agent_id: string;
  workspace_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  started_at: string;
  status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "awaiting_human";
  context: Record<string, unknown>;    // what the agent learned this run
  decisions: string[];                 // what it decided and why
  output_summary: string;             // human-readable result
};
```

### Agents

#### Researcher Agent
- **Role:** Ingest fresh signals from RSS feeds and manual sources
- **LLM role:** `research`
- **Trigger:** Scheduled (daily) or manual
- **Human gate:** No
- **Tools:**
  - `check_signal_freshness` — query signals table to determine staleness per directive
  - `ingest_directive` — run RSS ingest for a specific directive
  - `ingest_all` — run all directives (daily + weekly based on schedule)
  - `report_summary` — log what was ingested, what's new vs. skipped
- **Decision-making:** Checks which directives have stale signals (>24h for daily, >7d for weekly) and only runs those. Reports what it found.

#### Writer Agent
- **Role:** Generate editorial leads from fresh signals
- **LLM role:** `leads`
- **Trigger:** Event (fires after Researcher completes, if new signals were ingested)
- **Human gate:** No (leads are generated as `pending_review`)
- **Tools:**
  - `query_fresh_signals` — get signals from the last 14 days grouped by directive
  - `check_existing_leads` — check for duplicate angles before generating
  - `generate_leads` — call LLM to produce leads from signals
  - `save_leads` — persist leads to DB with proper deduplication
- **Decision-making:** Skips directives that already have sufficient pending leads. Adjusts lead count based on signal volume.

#### Editor Agent
- **Role:** Curate approved leads and generate newsletter/LinkedIn drafts
- **LLM role:** `editor` (curation), `drafting` (content generation)
- **Trigger:** Manual (user clicks "Generate Draft") — this stage requires human judgment on which leads to use
- **Human gate:** Yes — user must approve leads before Editor runs. User reviews draft before publishing.
- **Tools:**
  - `get_approved_leads` — fetch approved leads for the workspace
  - `curate_leads` — select best leads for a cohesive newsletter (existing Editor Agent curation)
  - `get_previous_titles` — avoid title repetition
  - `generate_thesis` — run thesis engine
  - `generate_angle` — generate editorial angle
  - `generate_draft` — produce the full draft
  - `apply_guardrails` — lint and auto-rewrite
  - `save_draft` — persist and move leads to `drafted`
- **Decision-making:** Evaluates lead pool quality. Can report "not enough fresh angles" instead of generating a weak draft.

#### Publisher Agent
- **Role:** Export and distribute finished drafts
- **LLM role:** None (no LLM needed — deterministic rendering)
- **Trigger:** Manual (human clicks publish)
- **Human gate:** Yes — human must review draft before publishing
- **Tools:**
  - `render_html` — convert draft to newsletter-ready HTML
  - `push_beehiiv` — create Beehiiv draft (feature-flagged)
  - `render_linkedin` — format for LinkedIn posting (Phase 2)

### Orchestrator

The **Pipeline Orchestrator** coordinates agent handoffs:

```
POST /api/pipeline/run
```

Accepts:
- `stages`: which agents to run (default: all non-gated)
- `workspace_id`: scope
- `options`: per-agent overrides

Behavior:
1. Runs Researcher Agent
2. If new signals were ingested → triggers Writer Agent
3. Writer generates leads → stops (human gate: lead approval)
4. When user triggers draft generation → runs Editor Agent
5. When user triggers publish → runs Publisher Agent

Each agent run is logged to the `runs` table with its `AgentRunState`, enabling full audit trail and trend analysis.

### Run State Persistence

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_runs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'running'
    CHECK (status IN ('running', 'completed', 'failed', 'awaiting_human')),
  context JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  decisions JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  output_summary TEXT,
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  triggered_by TEXT                    -- 'schedule', 'event:researcher_completed', 'manual', etc.
);
```

## 3.2 LLM Abstraction Layer [NEW]

### Overview

All LLM calls route through a unified provider abstraction. Each agent role can use a different provider and model, configured via environment variables.

**Implemented:** `lib/llm/provider.ts`

### Providers Supported
- **Anthropic** (Claude) — default
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, etc.)

### Configuration

```
# Global default
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Per-role overrides (format: provider:model)
LLM_RESEARCH=openai:gpt-4o-mini
LLM_LEADS=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
LLM_EDITOR=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
LLM_DRAFTING=openai:gpt-4o
LLM_REVISION=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
LLM_LINT=openai:gpt-4o-mini
LLM_LINKEDIN=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

### API

```typescript
callLLM(role: AgentRole, messages: LLMMessage[], opts?: LLMRequestOptions): Promise<LLMResponse>
getModelForRole(role: AgentRole): { provider: LLMProvider; model: string }
```

5. Generate LinkedIn drafts from approved leads or newsletter sections
6. Apply per-creator voice guardrails to all generated content
7. Allow regeneration of individual sections — newsletter and LinkedIn
8. Persist structured drafts — `DraftObject` for newsletter, `LinkedInDraftObject` for LinkedIn
9. Support creator onboarding via API-connected flow
10. Export publish-ready content for both channels via Publisher Agent
11. **Operate Research → Leads as an autonomous pipeline with human gate at lead approval**
12. **Support pluggable LLM providers per agent role**

Stretch:
13. LinkedIn Marketing API analytics pull
14. Direct LinkedIn post publishing via API
15. Scheduled pipeline automation (Vercel cron → Pipeline Orchestrator)
