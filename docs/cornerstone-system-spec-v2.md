# Cornerstone OS
## System Specification v2.4

Owner: OnTheCorner Media  
Module: Newsroom Engine + LinkedIn Module  
Status: Active Development  
Supersedes: v2.3 (sections marked **[REVISED]** replace prior equivalents; sections marked **[NEW]** are additive)

---

# 1. Core Mission [REVISED]

Cornerstone OS exists to eliminate blank page friction and transform research into structured, voice-consistent, monetizable media assets — for any B2B thought leadership creator.

It must:

- Ingest research autonomously
- Extract structured editorial angles
- Generate viewpoint-driven drafts
- Enforce per-creator writing constraints
- Support modular section regeneration
- Persist structured draft objects
- Prepare publish-ready drafts across multiple output channels
- Support multiple creators via workspace-scoped configuration
- **Operate as a team of specialized agents, not a sequence of button clicks**

It is infrastructure, not a chatbot. It is a product, not a single-creator tool. It is a newsroom, not a prompt template.

---

# 2. Design Principles [REVISED]

1. Structured over freeform
2. Modular over monolithic
3. Deterministic over magical
4. Persist state, do not recompute everything
5. Human approval before publish
6. Voice guardrails enforced at system level
7. Replaceable LLM abstraction
8. Creator-configured, not system-hardcoded
9. API-connected over file import
10. Workspace-scoped by default
11. **Agents over endpoints** — each pipeline stage is an autonomous agent with tools, memory, and judgment — not a dumb prompt call
12. **Human gates, not human labor** — humans approve, they don't operate

---

# 3. System Architecture [REVISED]

## 3.0 Multi-Tenancy Model
_Unchanged from v2.0._

---

## 3.1 Agent Architecture [NEW]

### Overview

Cornerstone OS operates as a **newsroom staffed by specialized agents**. Each agent has a defined role, a set of tools it can invoke, memory of its previous runs, and the ability to make autonomous decisions within its scope.

### Agent Definition

Each agent is defined by:

```typescript
type AgentDefinition = {
  id: string;                          // e.g. "researcher"
  name: string;                        // e.g. "Researcher Agent"
  role: AgentRole;                     // maps to LLM config
  systemPrompt: string;                // persistent identity and instructions
  tools: AgentTool[];                  // functions the agent can invoke
  triggerMode: "scheduled" | "event" | "manual";
  humanGate: boolean;                  // if true, agent stops and waits for human approval before next stage
};

type AgentTool = {
  name: string;                        // e.g. "query_signals"
  description: string;                 // what the tool does (provided to LLM)
  execute: (params: unknown) => Promise<unknown>;
};

type AgentRunState = {
  agent_id: string;
  workspace_id: string;
  run_id: string;
  started_at: string;
  status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "awaiting_human";
  context: Record<string, unknown>;    // what the agent learned this run
  decisions: string[];                 // what it decided and why
  output_summary: string;             // human-readable result
};
```

### Agents

#### Researcher Agent
- **Role:** Ingest fresh signals from RSS feeds and manual sources
- **LLM role:** `research`
- **Trigger:** Scheduled (daily) or manual
- **Human gate:** No
- **Tools:**
  - `check_signal_freshness` — query signals table to determine staleness per directive
  - `ingest_directive` — run RSS ingest for a specific directive
  - `ingest_all` — run all directives (daily + weekly based on schedule)
  - `report_summary` — log what was ingested, what's new vs. skipped
- **Decision-making:** Checks which directives have stale signals (>24h for daily, >7d for weekly) and only runs those. Reports what it found.

#### Writer Agent
- **Role:** Generate editorial leads from fresh signals
- **LLM role:** `leads`
- **Trigger:** Event (fires after Researcher completes, if new signals were ingested)
- **Human gate:** No (leads are generated as `pending_review`)
- **Tools:**
  - `query_fresh_signals` — get signals from the last 14 days grouped by directive
  - `check_existing_leads` — check for duplicate angles before generating
  - `generate_leads` — call LLM to produce leads from signals
  - `save_leads` — persist leads to DB with proper deduplication
- **Decision-making:** Skips directives that already have sufficient pending leads. Adjusts lead count based on signal volume.

#### Editor Agent
- **Role:** Editor-in-Chief. Reviews approved leads, makes all editorial decisions, and produces the newsletter draft.
- **LLM role:** `editor`
- **Trigger:** Event (fires after Writer Agent completes in the pipeline)
- **Human gate:** No — the Editor runs autonomously. The human gate is *after* the Editor, when the user reviews the finished draft before publishing.
- **Tools:**
  - `get_approved_leads` — fetch approved leads with angles, confidence scores
  - `evaluate_material` — analyze lead quality, theme diversity, and whether premium Insider Access content is warranted
  - `select_steering` — choose aggression, audience, focus, tone based on lead themes (with reasoning)
  - `generate_newsletter_draft` — run the full generation pipeline (thesis → angle → draft → lint) with chosen parameters
  - `update_draft_status` — mark draft status (draft/reviewed/published)
- **Decision-making:**
  - Refuses to draft if fewer than 3 approved leads
  - Autonomously selects steering parameters based on lead content (e.g., breach stories → high aggression, governance → analytical)
  - Decides output mode: `full_issue` always; `bundle` (with Insider Access) only when leads contain genuinely premium practitioner-grade content worth paying for
  - Insider Access is a paid offering — the Editor only produces it when the material warrants it
  - When Insider is produced in `bundle` mode, it is drafted **after** the public issue using the stored `content_json` (plus an allowlisted URL set), not by re-prompting raw leads alone

#### Draft Status Lifecycle

```
draft → reviewed → published
```
- `draft` — generated by Editor Agent
- `reviewed` — human has reviewed (optional)
- `published` — exported/pushed, this is the one that went out

Tracked via `status` column on `issue_drafts`:
```sql
ALTER TABLE issue_drafts ADD COLUMN status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft'
  CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'reviewed', 'published'));
```

#### Publisher Agent
- **Role:** Export and distribute finished drafts
- **LLM role:** None (no LLM needed — deterministic rendering)
- **Trigger:** Manual (human clicks publish)
- **Human gate:** Yes — human must review draft before publishing
- **Tools:**
  - `render_html` — convert draft to newsletter-ready HTML
  - `push_beehiiv` — create Beehiiv draft (feature-flagged)
  - `render_linkedin` — format for LinkedIn posting (Phase 2)

### Orchestrator

The **Pipeline Orchestrator** coordinates agent handoffs:

```
POST /api/pipeline/run
```

Accepts:
- `stages`: which agents to run (default: all non-gated)
- `triggered_by`: run provenance label (default: `manual`)

Workspace scope is taken from `WORKSPACE_ID` environment configuration.

Behavior:
1. Runs Researcher Agent — checks staleness, ingests stale directives
2. Runs Writer Agent — generates leads from fresh signals (skips if queue is full)
3. Runs Editor Agent — curates leads, selects steering, generates draft (refuses if <3 leads)
4. Human reviews the finished draft on the Issues page
5. Human triggers publish → runs Publisher Agent

The pipeline runs Researcher → Writer → Editor as a single autonomous sequence. The human gate is *after* the Editor, not before it.

Each agent run is logged to the `runs` table with agent metadata, enabling audit trail and trend analysis.

### Run State Persistence

```sql
-- Persisted via lib/agents/persistence.ts
INSERT INTO runs (
  workspace_id,
  run_type,
  status,
  input_refs_json,
  output_refs_json,
  finished_at
) VALUES (
  :workspace_id,
  'agent:' || :agent_id,
  :status,               -- initiated | completed | failed
  :input_refs_json,      -- includes agent_id, triggered_by, context
  :output_refs_json,     -- includes decisions, summary
  :finished_at
);
```

---

## 3.2 LLM Abstraction Layer [NEW]

### Overview

All LLM calls route through a unified provider abstraction. Each agent role can use a different provider and model, configured via environment variables.

**Implemented:** `lib/llm/provider.ts`

### Providers Supported
- **Anthropic** (Claude) — default
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, etc.)

### Configuration

```
# Global default
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Per-role overrides (format: provider:model)
LLM_RESEARCH=openai:gpt-4o-mini
LLM_LEADS=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
LLM_EDITOR=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
LLM_DRAFTING=openai:gpt-4o
LLM_REVISION=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
LLM_LINT=openai:gpt-4o-mini
LLM_LINKEDIN=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

### API

```typescript
callLLM(role: AgentRole, messages: LLMMessage[], opts?: LLMRequestOptions): Promise<LLMResponse>
getModelForRole(role: AgentRole): { provider: LLMProvider; model: string }
```

## 3.10 Content Outlines (structure templates) **[NEW]** **[REVISED in v2.3]**

### Purpose

**Content outlines** define *what* the system assembles (section order, Fresh Signals shape, JSON output contract text, Insider Access section labels, etc.). They are **workspace-scoped** and **separate from brand profiles**.

**Brand profiles** define *who is speaking* (voice, character, constraints, emoji policy, narrative preferences). **Outlines** define *the artifact shape* the drafting agent must produce.

This separation allows multiple outlines per workspace (e.g. weekly newsletter vs. digest vs. premium follow-up) without duplicating voice configuration.

### Data model

Table: `content_outlines` (see `lib/supabase/schema-content-outlines.sql`).

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `workspace_id` | Scope |
| `name` | Human label in UI |
| `kind` | `newsletter_issue` \| `insider_access` |
| `spec_json` | Versioned outline spec (see below) |
| `is_default` | At most one default per `(workspace_id, kind)` |
| `disabled_at` | **Soft disable:** `timestamptz` nullable; `NULL` = active. “Delete” in the app sets this timestamp and clears `is_default`. There is **no re-enable** path in the UI for v1 (restore would be a manual SQL or future API). |

`issue_drafts` may store optional `content_outline_id` for traceability (see `lib/supabase/schema-issue_drafts.sql`; generation writes it when a DB-backed newsletter outline row is used).

**Schema:** apply `lib/supabase/schema-content-outlines.sql` in Supabase (idempotent); existing databases need at least `ALTER TABLE content_outlines ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS disabled_at timestamptz;`.

### Spec JSON (v1)

**Newsletter (`kind: newsletter_issue`):**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "userPromptTemplate": "… placeholders {{PRIMARY_THESIS}}, {{STEERING_BLOCK}}, {{ANGLE_BLOCK}}, {{LEADS_BLOCK}}, {{PROMO_TEXT}} …",
  "systemPromptSuffix": "… appended after BRAND PROFILE JSON in the drafting system message …"
}
```

**Insider Access (`kind: insider_access`):**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "userPromptTemplate": "… {{PRIMARY_THESIS}}, {{STEERING_BLOCK}}, {{NEWSLETTER_SECTION}}, {{ALLOWED_URLS}}, {{LEADS_BLOCK}} …",
  "systemPromptTemplate": "… drafting system message …"
}
```

Built-in defaults live in code (`lib/content-outlines/default-specs.ts`). They are written to the database only through the app: `POST /api/content-outlines/seed` (Issues page: **Seed default outlines**) when a workspace has no outline rows yet. **Schema changes use SQL; outline row data is not maintained via checked-in seed SQL or one-off scripts.**

### REST API and UI **[REVISED]**

**List / create (collection)**

- `GET /api/content-outlines` — Returns `{ outlines }` (each row includes structured template fields derived from `spec_json`). By default only **active** rows (`disabled_at IS NULL`). Query `?includeDisabled=1` includes soft-disabled rows (e.g. Outlines admin list).
- `POST /api/content-outlines` — **Create.** Body uses **structured fields** only (no raw `spec_json` from the client): `name`, `kind`, `is_default`, `userPromptTemplate`, and either `systemPromptSuffix` (newsletter) or `insiderSystemPrompt` (Insider). Server validates, serializes to `spec_json`, returns `{ outline, warnings }`. `warnings` are non-blocking (e.g. missing `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens).
- `POST /api/content-outlines/seed` — Insert default newsletter + Insider rows **if the workspace has no outline rows** (Issues page: **Seed default outlines**). Row data is app-only, not from checked-in SQL seed files.

**Single resource**

- `GET /api/content-outlines/[id]` — `{ outline }` (includes disabled rows for read-only visibility).
- `PATCH /api/content-outlines/[id]` — **Update** merged fields; **400** if row is disabled. If `is_default` is set true, other defaults for that `(workspace_id, kind)` are cleared first.
- `DELETE /api/content-outlines/[id]` — **Soft disable:** sets `disabled_at`, clears `is_default`; **400** if already disabled.

**Issue generation**

- `POST /api/issues/generate` accepts optional `contentOutlineId` (newsletter, when `outputMode` is `full_issue` or `bundle`), `insiderContentOutlineId` (when `bundle` or `insider_access`), and optional `sourceDraftId` when `outputMode` is `insider_access` to generate Insider from a saved issue’s `content_json`.
- When an outline **id is provided**, the server **asserts** the row exists, is **not** disabled, and **`kind`** matches; otherwise **400/404** — no silent fallback to the code default for a bad id.
- When **no** outline id is sent, resolution uses DB default or **code default** spec (same text as seeded defaults).

**UI**

- **`/outlines`** — Workspace-admin style page: list, create, edit (kind fixed after create), placeholder hints, save warnings, soft disable. Sidebar **Outlines** + **Manage outlines** link from Issues.
- **Issues** outline dropdowns load **`GET /api/content-outlines`** (active rows only).

### Insider Access vs. public issue **[REVISED]**

Insider Access remains a **separate artifact** from the public newsletter. **Bundle mode** generates the full issue first, then generates Insider using:

1. The **structured newsletter** (`content_json` subset as JSON text) as the primary editorial substrate.
2. The **allowed URL list** from the issue (and leads for grounding).
3. The **Insider outline** (`insider_access` kind) for section structure.

Standalone `insider_access` mode may still run from **approved leads only** (`newsletterPayloadJson` absent), or from **`sourceDraftId`** (load `content_json` from `issue_drafts`).

### Editor Agent tools (conceptual)

- `generate_newsletter_draft` loads **brand profile** + **resolved newsletter outline** (by id or workspace default or code fallback), then runs thesis → angle → draft → lint.
- Insider generation runs **after** the public `DraftObject` exists (bundle) or from a stored draft / leads as above.

---

## 3.11 Content products (Issues — Phase 2 panel) **[NEW in v2.4]**

### Purpose

**Content products** turn a persisted **newsletter draft** (`issue_drafts.content_json` / `DraftObject`) into derivative assets: social posts, podcast-oriented output, and sponsorship alignment copy. They are invoked from the **Issues** page (“Phase 2 — content products”) and use LLM generation over a **compact text summary** of the draft (see `lib/content-products/promptContext.ts`).

Workspace scope follows `WORKSPACE_ID`. Inputs are either `draftId` (server loads `content_json`) or an in-memory `content_json` override for the same shape.

### Social snippets

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/content-products/social-snippets`

**Request body:** `{ draftId?: string, content_json?: object }` — one of the two must supply the draft; `draftId` requires a saved row in `issue_drafts` for the workspace.

**Response (normative):** Structured JSON only — `{ ok: true, snippets: { x_post, linkedin_teaser, threads } }` (strings). The API does not change for presentation concerns.

**Product requirement — UI:** The Issues UI **must not** show this payload as a raw JSON blob. It **must** render **formatted** panels per network (X, LinkedIn, Threads): readable typography, optional character counts against the limits enforced in the prompt (e.g. X ~260 characters, Threads ~500), and **copy-to-clipboard** per field (and optionally a single “copy all” as plain text). A developer-only or secondary “raw JSON” view is optional.

**Voice:** Same Identity Jedi constraints as implemented in the route (direct, practitioner-respecting; no em dashes; avoid lazy contrast patterns).

### Podcast and ElevenLabs audio pipeline

**Current implementation:** `POST /api/content-products/podcast-outline` produces a **talking-point outline** JSON: `working_title`, `hook`, `segments[]` with `beats[]`, `outro_cta`. Prompt context today is **draft text only** (summary from `content_json`), without resolving citation URLs to rows in the **signals** store.

**Target behavior (normative for Phase 2 content products):**

1. **Grounding — signals behind the content:** Build a **Signal grounding** block for the model by collecting URLs from `content_json.sources` and from URLs embedded in `fresh_signals` (and any other draft fields that carry citations). Resolve matching rows in workspace **`signals`** (title, publisher, URL; optional excerpt if available). The model must treat unresolved URLs as generic references only (no invented publication names).

2. **Script output (not beats-only):** The primary artifact becomes a **host-read script** suitable for **text-to-speech**: ordered `script_segments` (or equivalent) where each segment includes **full-sentence `narrator_text`**, not bullet beats. Optional metadata: `working_title`, `estimated_runtime_minutes`, `sources_acknowledged` (URLs or signal ids used explicitly in the script) for audit.

3. **TTS safety:** Prompt and validation must avoid stage directions that would be spoken unless using an explicit convention (e.g. strip markers before TTS). Plain text must be safe for ElevenLabs (or successor) ingestion.

4. **Route evolution:** The spec’s **contract** is the script + grounding behavior above. Implementation may introduce `POST /api/content-products/podcast-script` and deprecate `podcast-outline`, or evolve the existing route with a versioned response shape — migration details are left to implementation notes.

5. **ElevenLabs handoff:** Cornerstone calls ElevenLabs **server-side** using `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and workspace- or brand-scoped **voice** / model configuration (env or future brand profile fields). **Human gate before spend:** audio generation is triggered only by an explicit user action (e.g. “Generate audio”) after script preview — not automatically on every draft save unless a future product flag explicitly enables that. Chunking and concatenation follow **current ElevenLabs TTS API** limits and best practices (exact chunk sizes are implementation details).

6. **Persistence:** Store enough state to replay and audit: the **script JSON** and a reference to generated **audio** (URL, object storage path, or provider artifact id). Exact table or `metadata` extension is **TBD**; the requirement is durable script + audio linkage to the source `issue_drafts` row or workspace episode entity.

### Sponsorship alignment

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/content-products/sponsorship-alignment` — aligns draft context with revenue / sponsorship slots (experimental; same draft loading pattern as other content products).

**Note (spec vs code, v2.3):** Phase 1 roadmap language originally assumed a greenfield `agent_runs` table. The current codebase **reuses `runs`** for agent persistence and exposes **`/api/pipeline/run`** for development-style orchestration. Remaining Phase 1 work includes a **pipeline status dashboard**, **scheduled automation**, and tighter **human-gated** autonomy — see §8.

**Note (v2.4):** Phase 2 **content products** are specified in §3.11. Social API is done; **formatted Social UI** and **podcast script + signal grounding + ElevenLabs** are roadmap items aligned with §8 Phase 2B.

# 8. Roadmap [REVISED]

## Phase 1 — Agent Framework + Autonomous Pipeline
- **Landed:** agent abstraction (`lib/agents/framework.ts`) — definition, tool registry, run loop, role-routed LLM calls
- **Landed:** Researcher Agent — `check_signal_freshness`, `ingest_directive`, `report_summary` (`lib/agents/researcher.ts`)
- **Landed:** Writer Agent — `query_fresh_signals`, `check_existing_leads`, `generate_leads_for_directive` (`lib/agents/writer.ts`)
- **Landed:** Pipeline Orchestrator — `POST /api/pipeline/run` (staged researcher → writer → editor)
- **Landed:** agent run persistence via **`runs`** (`run_type` prefix `agent:`)
- **Hardening:** structured errors, clearer stage contracts, optional abort / human gate between stages; formalize `runs` contract in UI filters or migrate to **`agent_runs`** if queries outgrow `runs`
- **Autonomy:** Research → Leads should run on a schedule or events; **human gate at lead approval** remains non-negotiable
- **Remaining:** **pipeline status dashboard** (agent run history, failures, last trigger) — beyond the Research console “run pipeline” control

## Phase 2 — Brand Profile, LinkedIn Foundation, and Content Products

### Phase 2A — Brand profile refactor + LinkedIn foundation
- Deprecate `POST /api/brand-profiles/seed`
- Implement generic `CreatorBrandProfile` schema
- Build creator onboarding flow (Steps 1–5)
- Implement LinkedIn OAuth connection
- Add `channel` field to `editorial_leads`
- Add `linkedin_connections` and `linkedin_drafts` tables
- Add LinkedIn-specific lint patterns
- Migrate existing workspace through onboarding flow

### Phase 2B — Content products (Issues)
- **Social snippets — UI:** Render `snippets` as formatted X / LinkedIn / Threads panels with character guidance and copy actions; no raw JSON dump (see §3.11).
- **Podcast — script + grounding:** Enrich prompt context with **Signal grounding** (resolve draft citation URLs to workspace `signals`); replace beats-only outline with **TTS-ready script segments** (`narrator_text` prose) per §3.11.
- **ElevenLabs:** Server-side TTS using `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and configurable voice/model; **human-gated** “Generate audio” after script preview; chunk per provider limits; persist script + audio reference (storage TBD).
- **API evolution:** Introduce or rename podcast route to match the script contract; deprecate outline-only shape as needed (migration left to implementation).

## Phase 3 — LinkedIn Draft Engine
- Build LinkedIn generate / regenerate / list / publish endpoints
- Add LinkedIn tab to Issues page
- Add channel selector to Leads approval UI
- LinkedIn draft management UI
- Expand test suite

## Phase 4 — Direct Publishing + Analytics
- LinkedIn post publishing via API
- LinkedIn Marketing API analytics pull
- Feedback loop: performance data updates benchmarks
- Scheduled pipeline automation (Vercel cron → Pipeline Orchestrator)

## Phase 5 — Multi-Brand + Platform Expansion
- Multi-brand orchestration
- Revenue alignment scoring
- Semi-autonomous issue drafting with confidence scoring
- Additional output channels (Twitter/X, Substack Notes)
